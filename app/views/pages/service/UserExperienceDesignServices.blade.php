<div class="main_content">Avane is a trusted technology partner in building and delivering efficient, 
    enterprise-wide, scalable bespoke business systems and solutions across several technology platform.
     With ever increasing business competition corporations worldwide are forced to increasingly rely upon 
     reduced turnaround time. Our talented product engineering team have years of industry experience acquired 
     through various business engagements and successful project execution.
Our delivery model adheres and complies with industry standard best practices. Our global delivery model targets
 to rollout effective solutions always on time meeting or exceeding our customer’s expectations. We engage our
 customers in all key phases of our development process thereby enabling our customers to strategically control 
 the growth of software from initiation to rollout. This helps reducing development time, increased cost savings,
  early ROI, improved productivity and zero costly surprises and challenges.
Our team has experience in diverse software development methodologies and models like Agile, TDD, RUP, SCRUM, XP,
 Waterfall etc. with experience in heterogeneous environments. Out of the many Agile methods available,
  we find XP-Extreme Programming and Scrum best suited to provide our valuable clients the maximum benefit. 
   Taking alone any one of the models has some inherent limitations; hence, we arrived at a hybrid blend taking 
   the benefits of both models. Among the different agile practices, we have adopted Test Driven Development and 
   Continuous Integration.  Again, any one of these practices alone limits the flexibility in some development
    situations. So we have adapted to the best tenets of both, a blend that is difficult for our competitors to beat. 
We understand that some of our clients are price sensitive than others. With this in mind, we offer different models
 of collaboration. Each model has its own advantages and has an impact on the pricing. We help you build world-class 
 seamlessly integrated products be it cloud, mobile, web, content management, standalone back-office solutions and as
  well we provide testing services.</div>
